## Description:
For my final project in CS50x, I went out online and found some courses that taught how to make 2d pixel games
in PyGame for Python. The course I ended up working through and using my projects from as a reference was "Learn Python
by making games" by Christian Koch via [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com). The class specifically can be found [here](

).
